# Analysis Report 
Results shows that only 7.7% of the population visits eyecare health provider, 7.7% of the population also are with corrected vision by means of medicated lens. 
This would means that 30.8% of the population who are blind or have difficulty seeing do not visit eyecare health provider to get “correct” prescription for their sight.
Near distance defect is prevalent among younger adults.

# Recommendations
Educational campaigns speaking to the importance of eye care and eye checkup should be done frequently. The educational campaigns should involve parents
and guardians awareness, paying attention to their children eyesight and visiting eye health care practitioners.
Eyecare health practitioners should visit schools and more
Outreaches should be done frequently and younger adults should be educated on the causes of eye defects (especially near distance defect as it is prevalent
among young adults) and how it can be prevented.
